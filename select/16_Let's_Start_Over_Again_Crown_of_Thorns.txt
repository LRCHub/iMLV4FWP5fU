A thousand miles away
I'm reaching out to feel you each and every day
I miss lyin' there beside ya'
And I apologize I've got just one thing to say

Even if I'm wrong
Let's start over again
I've been with you so long
Let's start over again

No matter what I do
It's like a storm has come and left nothing but you
You see I'm like a lonely rider

Who's finally come to realize that it's all about give and take

Even if I'm wrong
Let's start over again
'Cause I've been with you so long
Let's start over again

Chorus

Well I know at times I've been wrong babe
Don't be gone, don't leave me dying, no
Yeah 'cause I've been, been with you so long
Let's start over again
